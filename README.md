# Risk-population-mapping
This project is to create a mapping between global world population data from the CIESIN: https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4
and risk maps comuted from climate data. 

The challenge consists in dealing with overlaping gridblock to avoit double counting of population.
